# Implementation Code of EvoPool

## Minimal Workflow

1) Training data can be generated by running `bash gen_data.sh`

2) Self-supervised training can be done by running `python pretrain_evopool.py`

3) Downstream zero-shot evaluation of trained models on ProteinGym can be done by running `python eval_evopool_proteingym.py`
